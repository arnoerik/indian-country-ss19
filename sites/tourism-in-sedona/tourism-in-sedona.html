      <h1>Native Americans in Tourism: How the Navajo, Hopi, and Hualapai Tribes have Reacted to Tourism in Arizona</h1>

	  <h4>By: Erikka Arno</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>    This page attempts to understand the sovereignty of tourist sites,  infrastructure, economic and marketing issues, cultural and spiritual appropriation of Native Americans. I delve into how Native American peoples and their land is viewed and treated within the construction of these grand tourist spaces on indigenous lands. This page seeks to understand how the Navajo, Hopi, and Hualapai tribes have been affected by the explosion of tourism and, more importantly, their agency within. And how the Native tourism sectors interact with the Arizona Travel and Tourism Sector.  I will specifically be investigating the state of Arizona at Sedona and the Grand Canyon. I will be analyzing Sedona’s tourism through the lens of the New Age movement that came about in the 1970’s. </p>

     <h3>Hualapai Tribe in Grand Canyon West, Arizona </h3>
     <a href="http://hualapai-nsn.gov/" > The Haulapai Tribe Website</a>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p>    Their glass sky walkway is located in the Grand Canyon West (west rim) on the Hualapai reservation. This reservation was created in 1883 in northwestern Arizona and encompasses part of the Colorado plateau and the Grand Wash Cliffs within its one million acres of ancestral land.   Hualapai means “People of the Tall Pines” as their one million acres of  land is beautifully covered with tall pine trees on the southside of the Grand Canyon and along the Colorado River.  The tribe has approximately 2,300 members; and majority of these tribal members live in the tribal capital of Peach Springs, Arizona in Mohave county.
	On their tribal website it states that their major economic activities are tourism, cattle-ranching, and arts and crafts. Their Grand Canyon Resort Corporation is owned and operated in their tribal capital of Peach Springs. The Hualapai offer an array of activities including white water rafting, hiking, helicopter rides, offers lodging and of course the famous Skywalk. I believe being located out west near the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon has aided their success in the tourism industry as the Grand Canyon is one of the natural wonders of the world. </p>

     <p> The Navajo reservation extends across northeastern Arizona, northwestern New Mexico, southeastern Utah and encompasses 27,000 square miles of land. The Navajo own the largest reservation in North America with a population around 350,000 people. The capital of the Navajo Nation is Window Rock, Arizona and encompasses an area of approximately six square miles. The Navajo Nation is well known for their beautiful red landscape of mountains, plateaus, and the Grand Canyon. The Navajo Tourism Department, based of of Window Rock, has five staff that oversee administration, marketing and project development.
     The Hopi tribe is a sovereign nation that is located in northeastern Arizona just east of the Grand Canyon.They are the westmost Pueblo Indian Tribe. The reservation is based within the Navajo Nation and Coconino county. The reservation makes up over 1.5 million acres of land. There are twelve villages in the Hopi towns spread over three mesas. Their reservation capital is Kykotsmovi Village.</p>

<h3> What does New Age mean and where did it come from?</h3>
<hr>
<p>The official definition of New Age is an eclectic group of cultural attitudes arising in the late twentieth century Western society that are adopted from a variety of ancient and modern cultures, that emphasize beliefs (such as reincarnation, holism, pantheism, and occultism) outside the mainstream, and that advance alternative approaches to spirituality, right living, and health (Merriam-Webster). New Age is also often described as a movement that advertises the possibility of  an age of light and love through self transformation and healing.
I will analyze the emergence of this new era through the lens of postmodern culture of consumer capitalism (Aldred 2000). It’s been argued by scholars that the New Age movement is actually a social product of current economic ideology of consumer capitalism that we live by. Scholar Lisa Aldred argues that the “baby boomer” generation feel disconnected from any cultural traditions and religion. Therefore, they seek spiritual significance elsewhere which catalyzed the New Age movement. They identify themselves as a ‘countercultural’ group (Aldred 2000). Countercultural means not agreeing with or following the current social norm. This is ironic because the main way ‘New agers’ participate within this counterculture is through consuming products such as crystals, self-help books, Native American spirituality books, workshops, meditation retreats, etc. But, engrossing these products cannot be enough to create a true ‘culture’. People who identify as New Age are a group with no history, traditions, true culture or meaning. I believe this is a big reason why New agers in the United States fetishize and romanticize Native American peoples.
 The most important aspects of this movement are: the focus on self and ‘self transformation’, the search for authenticity, and the centralization of spirituality. These are important to understand the impact this has on Native American culture while also understanding what meaning it holds to New agers.
