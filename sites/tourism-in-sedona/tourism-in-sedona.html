      <h1>Native Americans in Tourism: How the Navajo, Hopi, and Hualapai Tribes have Reacted to Tourism in Arizona</h1>

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p>    This page attempts to understand the sovereignty of tourist sites,  infrastructure, economic and marketing issues, cultural and spiritual appropriation of Native Americans. I delve into how Native American peoples and their land is viewed and treated within the construction of these grand tourist spaces on indigenous lands. This page seeks to understand how the Navajo, Hopi, and Hualapai tribes have been affected by the explosion of tourism and, more importantly, their agency within. And how the Native tourism sectors interact with the Arizona Travel and Tourism Sector.  I will specifically be investigating the state of Arizona at Sedona and the Grand Canyon. I will be analyzing Sedona’s tourism through the lens of the New Age movement that came about in the 1970’s. </p>

     <h3>Hualapai Tribe in Grand Canyon West, Arizona </h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <br>
     <p>   Their glass sky walkway is located in the Grand Canyon West (west rim) on the Hualapai reservation. This reservation was created in 1883 in northwestern Arizona and encompasses part of the Colorado plateau and the Grand Wash Cliffs within its one million acres of ancestral land.   Hualapai means “People of the Tall Pines” as their one million acres of  land is beautifully covered with tall pine trees on the southside of the Grand Canyon and along the Colorado River.  The tribe has approximately 2,300 members; and majority of these tribal members live in the tribal capital of Peach Springs, Arizona in Mohave county.
	On their tribal website it states that their major economic activities are tourism, cattle-ranching, and arts and crafts. Their Grand Canyon Resort Corporation is owned and operated in their tribal capital of Peach Springs. The Hualapai offer an array of activities including white water rafting, hiking, helicopter rides, offers lodging and of course the famous Skywalk. I believe being located out west near the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon has aided their success in the tourism industry as the Grand Canyon is one of the natural wonders of the world. </p>

     The Hopi tribe is a sovereign nation that is located in northeastern Arizona just east of the Grand Canyon.They are the westmost Pueblo Indian Tribe. The reservation is based within the Navajo Nation and Coconino county. The reservation makes up over 1.5 million acres of land. There are twelve villages in the Hopi towns spread over three mesas.

<h3> What does New Age mean and where did it come from?</h3>
<hr>
<p>The official definition of New Age is an eclectic group of cultural attitudes arising in the late twentieth century Western society that are adopted from a variety of ancient and modern cultures, that emphasize beliefs <br> (such as reincarnation, holism, pantheism, and occultism) outside the mainstream, and that advance alternative approaches to spirituality, right living, and health (Merriam-Webster).
New Age is also often described as a movement that advertises the possibility of  an age of light and love through self transformation and healing. There are practices of shamanism, goddess worship, Eastern religions, crystal energies, pagan rituals, extraterrestrials and channeling spirit beings.United States Native American is of very popular interest, especially among Native Americans<br> located in the southwestern U.S.</p>

<p> In many scholarly writings the New Age movement is attributed to postmodern culture of consumer capitalism. Scholar Lisa Aldred argues that the “baby boomer” generation feel disconnected from any <br> cultural traditions and religion. Therefore, they seek spiritual significance elsewhere which catalyzed the <br> New Age movement. Native American spirituality is the most popular and profitable sectors of New Age commercialization. They consume products such as crystals, self-help books, dream catchers,<a href = "http://www.sedona-spiritualretreats.com/native-american.html"> Native American spiritual workshops </a>, <a href ="https://visitsedona.com/tours-travel-trade/sample-itineraries/3-night-4-day-native-american/" >'Native American Tours'</a>, etc. However, engrossing these products cannot be enough to create a true ‘culture’. People who identify as New Age are a group with no history, traditions, community or meaning. </p>

</p> The most important aspects of this movement are: the focus on self and ‘self transformation’, the search for authenticity, and the centralization of spirituality. These are important to understand the impact this has on Native American culture while also understanding what meaning it holds to New agers. </P>

<h3> <i>Differences between Native American Beliefs and New Age Beliefs </i> </h3>

<table style="width:100%">
 <tr>
   <th><b> Native American beliefs </b></th>
   <th> <b> New Age beliefs </b></th>
  </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><li>Pluralism. Indian beliefs are generally pluralistic, meaning that your beliefs are right for you, and our beliefs are right for us. There's a caveat, however: The religion that is "right" for you is determined by your nationality. I know <br>little about Hopi beliefs, for example.</li> </td>
   <br>
   <td><li>Syncretism. New Age beliefs mix and match. Mix Hopi prophecies with Lakota ceremonies, as well as non-Indian beliefs such as karma, zen, channeling, tarot cards, paranormal, Western psychology, tantra, and God only knows what else in a haphazard manner, and you've got a typical New Age cocktail.</li> </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><li>Indian beliefs hold that spirituality is deeply taboo, especially when talking with foreigners.</li> </td>
   <td><li>Taboos. New Age has no taboos.</li> </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td> <li>Method of transferring information. There are no Indian sacred texts; we transfer information orally. In fact, most Indian languages have no written form. (And BTW, those that do are significantly different from non-Indian written languages.) Further, it is ONLY transferred in that language.</li> </td>
   <td><li>Method of transferring information. New Age belief systems usually have MANY books. These books will run anywhere from $5.99 for a paperback version to $29.99 for a hardcover. Many other media are used in New Age.</li> </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><li>Outlook. Completely integrated into one's lifestyle, not thought of as <br> "religion" as much as a way of life</li></td>
   <td> <li>Outlook. Grab bag; views Indian beliefs as compatible with Western philosophy</li></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td> <li>Ancestors communicate with Indians</li></td>
   <td><li>Ancestors communicate with non-Indians</li></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><li>Nation-specific. ALL Indians know what nation they belong to, and <br> traditionals practice the beliefs of their respective nations</li></td>
   <td><li>Generic stereotypes. Obvious mixing, such as totem poles and dream catchers, can be found. Generally speaking, New Agers have only recently discovered their Indian heritage, if they have any at all.</li></td>

<h4> <i> “Native Americans are reduced to a particular type of object- an ancient, heroic sage. They are objects in this New Age tourism industry; something that is known and acted upon." (Coats 2007)</i> </h4>
<hr>
<h3> Impact of the New Age Movement on Native Americans: How does it affect them personally and within the tourism industry? </h3>
<br>
<p> </p>

<p> Sedona, Arizona is full of natural rustic red landscape. With mountains, plateaus, the Red Rocks, the Grand Canyon, etc. It’s always had its place among popular tourist spots. But the largely imagined Native presence is implored by the followers of the New Age movement and imposed ancient wisdom, strong Native spirituality and mythical connections onto the people and the landscape as well. The Arizona tourism industry saw this ‘mystical’ enticement started using the same kind of language in advertising brochures which perpetuated this contrived Native American identity.
 The people who own craft shops in Sedona often sell "ceremonial supplies", such as: turkey feathers, sage smudgesticks, palo santo, etc. These items can promote the commodification of Native American spirituality. It contrast, this would be along the same lines of someone selling the challic for wine and communion bread used in Catholic churches. Native Americans need much more economic support to get truly involved in the tourism/travel industry. This comes down to better communication between indigenous and the non-indigenous communities and their involvement with each other.</p>
<br>
<hr>

<h3> Navajo, Hopi, and Hualapi Sovereignty Over Tourism </h3>
<hr>

<p>Despite the rise of the New Age movement in the past three decades that has appropriated Native American culture and romanticized the image of the ‘simple, ancient shaman’  , Native American agency over tourism is looking up. Evidence from the Hualapai owned skywalkway that opened in 2007.  Although, there are plenty of shops that do buy authentic products direct from Hopi and Navajo artists there seem to be no shops actually owned by the Hopi or Navajo people in Sedona despite their products being sold everywhere. This comes down to better communication between indigenous and the non-indigenous communities, their involvement and development with each other.
	<a href = “https://www.doi.gov/iacb”>  The Indian Arts and Crafts board </a> is important, especially in the Native American tourism industry. The board was established when the Indian Arts and Craft Act was passed in 1990. This act is a truth-advertising law that protects the authenticity of Native American products. It prohibits the misrepresentation in the marketing of  Indian arts and crafts. A product can’t be on sale that might suggest its Indian produced when it is not. The American Indian Alaskan Native Tourists Association is helping tribal organizations engage in cultural tourism. This organization help grows tribal tourism through technical assistance, providing education resources, and training.  </p>
