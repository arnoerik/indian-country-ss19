      <h1>Native Americans in Tourism: How the Navajo, Hopi, and Hualapai Tribes have Reacted to Tourism in Arizona</h1>
      <h3> </h3>
	  <h4>By: Erikka Arno</h4>
         <h3>Introduction</h3>
		 <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
		 <p> This page attempts to understand the sovereignty of tourist sites,  infrastructure, economic and marketing issues, cultural and spiritual appropriation of Native Americans. I delve into how Native American peoples and their land is viewed and treated within the construction of these grand tourist spaces on indigenous lands. This page seeks to understand how the Navajo, Hopi, and Hualapai tribes have been affected by the explosion of tourism and, more importantly, their agency within. And how the Native tourism sectors interact with the Arizona Travel and Tourism Sector.  I will specifically be investigating the state of Arizona at Sedona and the Grand Canyon. I will be analyzing Sedona’s tourism through the lens of the New Age movement that came about in the 1970’s. </p>

     <h3>Hualapai Tribe in Grand Canyon West, Arizona </h3>
     <a href="http://hualapai-nsn.gov/" > The Haulapai Tribe Website</a>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <p> Their glass sky walkway is located in the Grand Canyon West (west rim) on the Hualapai reservation. This reservation was created in 1883 in northwestern Arizona and encompasses part of the Colorado plateau and the Grand Wash Cliffs within its one million acres of ancestral land.   Hualapai means “People of the Tall Pines” as their one million acres of  land is beautifully covered with tall pine trees on the southside of the Grand Canyon and along the Colorado River.  The tribe has approximately 2,300 members; and majority of these tribal members live in the tribal capital of Peach Springs, Arizona in Mohave county.
	On their tribal website it states that their major economic activities are tourism, cattle-ranching, and arts and crafts. Their Grand Canyon Resort Corporation is owned and operated in their tribal capital of Peach Springs. The Hualapai offer an array of activities including white water rafting, hiking, helicopter rides, offers lodging and of course the famous Skywalk. I believe being located out west near the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon has aided their success in the tourism industry as the Grand Canyon is one of the natural wonders of the world. </p>
