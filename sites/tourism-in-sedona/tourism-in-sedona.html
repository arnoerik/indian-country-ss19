		 <p>    This page attempts to understand the sovereignty of tourist sites,  infrastructure, economic and marketing issues, cultural and spiritual appropriation of Native Americans in the United States southwest. I delve into how Native American peoples and their land is viewed and treated within the tourist space of Sedona, Arizona and the Grand Canyon. I will be analyzing Sedona’s tourism through the lens of the New Age movement that came about in the 1970’s. </p>

     <h3>What Tribes reside near Sedona, Arizona?  </h3>
     <h3> The Navajo and Hopi Tribes</h3>
     <hr><!--this draws a line across the page, which I put under each section heading in the example-->
     <br>

The Navajo own the largest reservation in North America with a population around 350,000 people. The capital of the Navajo Nation is Window Rock, Arizona and encompasses an area of approximately six square miles(discovernavajo.com). The Navajo Nation is well known for their beautiful red landscape of mountains, plateaus, and the Grand Canyon.  <a href="https://www.discovernavajo.com/about-the-department.aspx" > The Navajo Tourism Department</a> , based out of Window Rock, has five staff that oversee administration, marketing and project development.</p>
      <p>  <a href="https://www.hopi-nsn.gov/The"> Hopi tribe </a>is a sovereign nation that is located in northeastern Arizona just east of the Grand Canyon.They are the westmost Pueblo Indian Tribe.

<h3> What does New Age mean and where did it come from?</h3>
<hr>
<p>The official definition of New Age is an eclectic group of cultural attitudes arising in the late twentieth century Western society that are adopted from a variety of ancient and modern cultures, that emphasize beliefs  <br> (such as reincarnation, holism, pantheism, and occultism) outside the mainstream, and that advance alternative approaches to spirituality, right living, and health (Merriam-Webster).
New Age is also often described as a movement that advertises the possibility of  an age of light and love through self transformation and healing. There are practices of shamanism, goddess worship, Eastern religions, crystal energies, pagan rituals, extraterrestrials and channeling spirit beings.United States Native American is of very popular interest, especially among Native Americans<br> located in the southwestern U.S. (Aldred 2000)</p>

<p> The New Age movement is attributed to postmodern culture of consumer capitalism. Scholar Lisa Aldred argues that the “baby boomer” generation feel disconnected from any <br> cultural traditions and religion. Therefore, they seek spiritual significance elsewhere which catalyzed the <br> New Age movement. Native American spirituality is the most popular and profitable sectors of New Age commercialization. They consume products such as crystals, self-help books, dream catchers,<a href = "http://mail.sunderdevi.com/Sedona/"> Native American spiritual workshops </a>, <a href ="https://visitsedona.com/tours-travel-trade/sample-itineraries/3-night-4-day-native-american/" >Native American Tours</a>, etc. However, engrossing these products cannot be enough to create a true ‘culture’. People who identify as New Age are a group with no history, traditions, community or meaning (Aldred 2000) </p>

</p> The most important aspects of this movement are: the focus on self and ‘self transformation’, the search for authenticity, and the centralization of spirituality. These are important to understand the impact this has on Native American culture while also understanding what meaning it holds to New agers (Aldred 2000). </P>

<h4> <i> “Native Americans are reduced to a particular type of object- an ancient, heroic sage. They are objects in this New Age tourism industry; something that is known and acted upon." (Coats 2007)</i> </h4>
<hr>
<h3> Now that we understand the New Age movement,how does it affect Navajo and Hopi Tribes? </h3>
<br>

<p> Sedona, Arizona is full of natural rustic red landscape. With mountains, plateaus, the Red Rocks, the Grand Canyon, etc. It’s always had its place among popular tourist spots. But the largely imagined Native presence is implored by the followers of the New Age movement, imposed ancient wisdom, contrived Native spirituality and mythical connections onto the people and the landscape as well. The Arizona tourism industry saw this ‘mystical’ enticement started using the same kind of language and images of Navajo tribe member's in advertising brochures which perpetuated this contrived Native American identity.
 The people who own craft shops in Sedona often sell "ceremonial supplies", such as: turkey feathers, sage smudgesticks, palo santo, etc. These items can promote the commodification of Native American spirituality, like an entire culture can be bought and used. It contrast, this would be along the same lines of someone selling the challic for wine and communion bread used in Catholic churches. Native Americans need much more economic support from the Arizona Tourism Department to get truly involved in the tourism/travel industry. This comes down to better communication between indigenous and the non-indigenous communities and their involvement with each other.</p>
<br>
<hr>

<h3> Navajo, Hopi, and Hualapi Sovereignty Over Tourism </h3>
<hr>

<p>Despite the rise of the New Age movement in the past three decades that has appropriated Native American culture and romanticized the image of the ‘simple, ancient shaman’  , Native American agency over tourism is looking up. Evidence from the Hualapai owned skywalkway that opened in 2007.  Although, there are plenty of shops that do buy authentic products direct from Hopi and Navajo artists there seem to be no shops actually owned by the Hopi or Navajo people in Sedona despite their products being sold everywhere. This comes down to better communication between indigenous and the non-indigenous communities, their involvement and development with each other.
	<a href = “https://www.doi.gov/iacb”>  The Indian Arts and Crafts board </a> is important, especially in the Native American tourism industry. The board was established when the Indian Arts and Craft Act was passed in 1990. This act is a truth-advertising law that protects the authenticity of Native American products. It prohibits the misrepresentation in the marketing of  Indian arts and crafts. A product can’t be on sale that might suggest its Indian produced when it is not. The American Indian Alaskan Native Tourists Association is helping tribal organizations engage in cultural tourism. This organization help grows tribal tourism through technical assistance, providing education resources, and training.  </p>
